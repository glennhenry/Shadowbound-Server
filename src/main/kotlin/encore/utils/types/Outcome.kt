/**
 * Represents the summary of an operation, capturing success with a value
 * or failure without exposing exceptions.
 *
 * Use [Outcome.Ok] when the operation succeeded and [Outcome.Fail] when it fails.
 *
 * This type shares the similar idea with [Result], but intentionally
 * does not carry a `Throwable`. It is designed for cases where:
 * - The caller requests an operation from another component.
 * - The caller only cares about whether the operation succeeded or failed
 *   and the value it produces from the success case.
 * - The caller does not need the underlying exception or error details.
 *
 * It is also similar to [Report] but outcome has value on the success case.
 *
 * @param T The type of value produced when the operation succeeds.
