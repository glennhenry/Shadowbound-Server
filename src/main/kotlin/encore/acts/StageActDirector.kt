/**
 * Manage and provide entry point to run [StageAct].
 *
 * #### Usage
 *
 * - [run] to start a new stage act in normal behavior.
 * - [runContinue] to run a stage act in a continuation context which will
 *   skip the [StageAct.onStart] lifecycle and continue running in normal behavior.
 * - [performAndContinue] to run a stage act and call perform directly.
 *   This will also skip the [StageAct.onStart] lifecycle and continue running
 *   in normal behavior.
 *
 * Any of the call will return while also starting the act immediately.
 * Each will also produce a unique runtime identifier of the stage act.
 *
 * #### Lifecycle
 *
 * During normal behavior, a newly started act will:
 * - call [StageAct.onStart].
 * - enters execution loop and waits for the delay returned by [Choreography.next].
 * - call [StageAct.perform].
 * - repeat the process until repetition is finished.
 * - call [StageAct.onEndingFairy] on finish.
 *
 * In other circumstances:
 * - call [StageAct.onCancelled] whenever the act is stopped via [stop],
 *   which may happen manually or from conditions like process shutdown,
 *   player disconnect, etc.
 * - call [StageAct.onError] whenever any error was thrown throughout its
 *   lifecycle or logic.
 *
 * #### Cancellation
 *
 * A running act can be cancelled via [stop]. This will cancel the running
 * coroutine with a `CancellationException`.
 *
 * During act's execution or lifecycle, a cancellation can happen in mid-execution.
 * Due to this, implementations may protect critical sections using
 * `withContext(NonCancellable)` to ensure atomic execution of important
 * operations such as persistence updates or consistency-sensitive state changes.
 *
 * Stage act can also cancel itself by throwing `CancellationException` within
 * its lifecycle.
 *
 * ##### Identity
 *
 * Running a stage act returns an act identifier (UUID). Stopping a stage act
 * requires this unique identifier. Application may use component like [ActIdStore]
 * to store the ID and retrieve it using another identifier which the application
 * can derive themself (e.g., derivable with input from [ActConcept]).
 *
 * Storing the identifier is done through the [ActIdStore.bind]. This process should
 * be done **manually** by user. Beside, the reverse [ActIdStore.unbind] process
 * is done by the director. This is because not every acts needs a cancellation behavior.
 * Furthermore, binding requires a string identity known by user.
 *
 * #### Continuation
 *
 * The stage act system acts solely as a runtime scheduler and executor.
 * It does not automatically persist or resume unfinished acts.
 *
 * Continuation is handled explicitly by the application by:
 * - persisting the required progress data.
 * - re-running the act with updated scheduling information.
 * - depending on requirement, may catch-up missed executions.
 *
 * This is typically achieved by [ActConcept] taking data which is
 * then used by [StageAct.choreography] to derive the execution's timing.
 *
 * In other word, a stage act resumpsion is modeled as re-running with different
 * scheduling state through runtime inputs.
 *
 * ##### Progress persistence
 *
 * Stage act implementations may persist progress data within their
 * lifecycle hooks. For instance:
 * - saving `actFinishedAt`
 * - storing remaining duration
 * - marking finished state
 *
 * During player's reconnection or application recovery, the application may:
 * - load the persisted progress data,
 * - reconstruct the corresponding act instance, and
 * - re-run the act with the updated scheduling logic.
 *
 * When error occur, [StageAct.onError] will be called and act may:
 * - mark state as invalid
 * - delete persisted progress data
 * - notify client
 *
 * @property timeSource Component that provides time. Use [SystemTimeSource] for real usage.
 * @property actStore Provides storage and access for running act identifiers.
