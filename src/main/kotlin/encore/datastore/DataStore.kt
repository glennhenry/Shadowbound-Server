/**
 * A suspendable persistence component that provides access to player and server data.

 * - [PlayerAccount]: player's account data.
 * - [PlayerObjects]: player's game data.
 * - [PlayerServerObjects]: player's non-game, server related data.
 * - [ServerObjects]: server's operational or game data.
 *
 * Implementation exposes way to retrieve the core collections and player creation.
 *
 * Higher-level operations such as player creation or alteration of certain player
